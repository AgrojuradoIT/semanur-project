To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require filament/filament:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require filament/filament:^2.1" if you know which you need.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
